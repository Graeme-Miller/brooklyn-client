                 Apache Brooklyn Command Line Client

What is it?
-----------

A command line client, "br", for Apache Brooklyn (https://brooklyn.apache.org).

With this tool you can deploy and manage applications on a running Brooklyn server.

Documentation
-------------

There follows below a brief summary of how to use the tool, however, the full documentation for the tool is included
along with the [Brooklyn Documentation](https://brooklyn.apache.org/v/latest/ops/cli/cli-ref-guide.html).

Licensing
---------

Please see the file called LICENSE.

Getting the right binary
------------------------

The release for the tool includes binaries built for a number of platforms and architectures. These binaries are
provided in subdirectories alongside this README, named for the platform and architecture:

darwin.386/br
darwin.amd64/br
freebsd.386/br
freebsd.amd64/br
linux.386/br
linux.amd64/br
netbsd.386/br
netbsd.amd64/br
openbsd.386/br
openbsd.amd64/br
windows.386/br
windows.amd64/br

To use the tool, add the appropriate subdirectory to your PATH, for example, when br is obtained by extracting the
main Apache Brooklyn release into your home directory under "apache-brooklyn", then the command would be like

$ PATH=$PATH:$HOME/apache-brooklyn/bin/brooklyn-client-cli-0.9.0/linux.amd64


Running
-------

Ensure your path contains $GOPATH/bin.

First, log in to your Brooklyn instance with:

    $ br login URL [USER PASSWORD]

See the help command for info on all commands:

    $ br help

And for help on individual commands:

    $ br help COMMAND

as follows (values in brackets are aliases for the scope):

- application APP-ID   (app, a)  
 Selects an application, e.g. "br app myapp"

- entity      ENT-ID   (ent, e)
 Selects an entity within an application scope, e.g. "br app myapp ent myserver"

- effector    EFF-ID   (eff, f)
 Selects an effector of an entity or application, e.g. "br a myapp e myserver eff xyz"

- config      CONF-KEY (conf, con, c)
 Selects a configuration key of an entity e.g. "br a myapp e myserver config jmx.agent.mode"

- activity    ACT-ID   (act, v)
 Selects an activity of an entity e.g. "br a myapp e myserver act iHG7sq1"
